# Conclusion

- Based on the observations and the data provided, the assumption that in some cases the national distribution center should be better does not seem to hold true for the products analyzed. The significantly higher outbound transportation cost for the national distribution center (2.4x higher) consistently drives up the total daily cost across different products, making the regional distribution centers more cost-effective.

#### Analysis Summary:

- For Product 1, Product 2, and Product 3, the regional distribution centers consistently show lower total daily costs compared to the national distribution center. The primary reason for this is the higher outbound transportation cost associated with the national distribution center.

#### Why Regional Distribution Centers are Better:

- Transportation Costs: The national distribution center's outbound transportation cost is $0.24 per unit, compared to $0.10 per unit for regional centers. This significant difference heavily impacts the total transportation cost.

- Total Daily Cost: Despite potential benefits in other areas, the high transportation cost leads to a higher total daily cost for the national distribution center across all products analyzed.

#### Assumption Re-evaluation:

- The initial assumption that a national distribution center might be better for some products does not hold true in this case due to the high outbound transportation costs. The analysis shows that regional distribution centers are more cost-effective for all three products.

- While the assumption that a national distribution center might be advantageous for some products was initially considered, the data does not support this hypothesis. The consistently lower total daily costs for regional distribution centers across different products highlight the importance of transportation costs in the overall cost structure.

###### However, there are scenarios in which a national distribution center could be more advantageous:

- Reduced Transportation Costs: If the outbound transportation costs for the national distribution center could be reduced significantly (e.g., through better logistics, bulk shipping discounts, or new transportation contracts), the overall cost efficiency might improve.

- High Demand Variability: In cases where there is high variability in demand across different regions, a national distribution center might better buffer this variability, leading to lower safety stock requirements and, consequently, lower holding costs.

- Economies of Scale: If the national distribution center could achieve significant economies of scale in other areas (e.g., procurement, storage, or handling), these savings might offset the higher transportation costs.

- Strategic Location: If the national distribution center is strategically located to serve a majority of the market efficiently, reducing the average distance to customers, it might lead to overall lower transportation costs and faster delivery times.

In conclusion, while the current analysis favors regional distribution centers due to lower transportation costs, certain conditions and strategic improvements could make a national distribution center a viable and cost-effective solution. These conditions include reduced transportation costs, high demand variability, economies of scale, and strategic location. Therefore, while regional distribution centers are currently more cost-effective, there are scenarios where a national distribution center could provide significant advantages.
